# Basic Usage

### 0. Installation
> On Macos Install
```bash
brew install --cask mysql-connector-python
```
```bash
pip install simple_migrator
```

### 1. Setup
```bash
simple_migrator setup {DATABASE_URL}
```
> Result:-
```bash

### 2. Create 
```bash
simple_migrator create {MIGRATION_NAME} 
```
> Result:-
```bash

```
### 3. Apply 
i. There are two ways to apply the migration. One way is to apply all the latest pending migrations.
```bash
simple_migrator up  
```
> Result:-
```bash
Going to run the following migrations:
 1704096783004737000_migration_3.sql
Migraiton 1704096783004737000_migration_3.sql: COMPLETED
The following migration runned Successfully: ['1704096783004737000_migration_3.sql']
```
ii. Another way to do this is to give the files name to the up command. 
> Note that this method will rerun the given migrations file.
```bash
simple_migrator up --f 1703509439.048595_temp
```
> Result:-
```bash
Going to run the following migrations:
 1704097419937590000_migration_0.sql
Migraiton 1704097419937590000_migration_0.sql: COMPLETED
The following migration runned Successfully: ['1704097419937590000_migration_0.sql']
```

### 3. Rollback 
i. Similar to "up" migration there are two ways to do this 
```bash
simple_migrator down 
```
> Result:-
```bash
Going to run the following migrations:
 ['1704097461646876000_migration_1.sql']
Rollback Migraiton 1704097461646876000_migration_1.sql completed
All migration rollback successfully.
```
ii. Another way to do this is to give the files name to the up command. 
> Note that this method will rollback every migration no matter if they were applied or not.
```bash
simple_migrator down --files 1703509439.048595_temp
```
> Result:-
```sql
Going to run the following migrations:
 ['1704097419937590000_migration_0.sql']
Rollback Migraiton 1704097419937590000_migration_0.sql completed
All migration rollback successfully.
```

# TDOD:
* [x] Make it so that the project does not reset when the setup is called twice.(There must be a better way).
* [x] Add tests to ensure that it works.
* [x] Add tests with other databases to ensure that it works.
* [x] Add a decorator so that we can check if setup is correctly done and exists gracefully.
* [x] Make sql errors more visible. (Could be better)
* [ ] Exist gracefully when database name is suppied properly.
